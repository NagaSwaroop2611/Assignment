  <p id="para">Infuse Your Life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. MAke
    your own
    love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high,
    but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth. - <br>
